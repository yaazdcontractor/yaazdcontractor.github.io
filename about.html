          Yaazd Contractor is an artist and designer from Mumbai, India, whose practice is balanced between physical
          and virtual objects. His creations range from video games, videos and 3D simulation to explorations of neon,
          metal and wood, the specifics of which vary by piece. He generates their foundations on computers, upon which
          he builds using a multidisciplinary approach tailored to each project. His object-oriented practice results in
          interactive experiences that tackle the influence of technology on our material world. Within this constantly
          changing landscape of technology, his practice is constantly evolving as new avenues of exploration open. In
          keeping up with technology, he builds heterotopias and mirror-worlds, realms where the common rules we play
          by don’t apply. These realms are framed within systems of home, possession, and mass production. The multi-
          faceted conversation each piece engages in is open to anybody, inviting viewers and users to refuel their
          imagination and glimpse a world parallel to this one.
