        <p>
          As a creator of both digital and physical, as well as fine and functional works, I describe myself as a multi-disciplinary artist. Having grown up in Mumbai, surfing the tidal waves of the internet and its open-source nature, and later maturing in the industrial heart of Chicago’s do-it-yourself scene, I constantly draw inspiration from the two cities and their zeitgeist. Architecture, video-games and music were integral facets of my upbringing, yet they fall out of their real-world applications and into heterotopias of their own in the objects I create. Combining mass fabricated and computer generated objects with hand worked glass is my current oeuvre.

        Yaazd Contractor is an artist and designer from Mumbai, India, whose practice is balanced between physical
        and virtual objects. His creations range from video games, videos and 3D simulation to explorations of neon,
        metal and wood, the specifics of which vary by piece. He generates their foundations on computers, upon which
        he builds using a multidisciplinary approach tailored to each project. His object-oriented practice results in
        interactive experiences that tackle the influence of technology on our material world. Within this constantly
        changing landscape of technology, his practice is constantly evolving as new avenues of exploration open. In
        keeping up with technology, he builds heterotopias and mirror-worlds, realms where the common rules we play
        by don’t apply. These realms are framed within systems of home, possession, and mass production. The multi-
        faceted conversation each piece engages in is open to anybody, inviting viewers and users to refuel their
        imagination and glimpse a world parallel to this one.
